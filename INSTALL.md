# Installing Track Tamer

These steps set up Track Tamer on a Mac or Windows computer. No
programming is needed. Installing takes about 10–15 minutes, most of it
waiting, and needs an internet connection.

There are two ways to install:

- **Method 1: Double-click.** The easiest. Works on Mac and Windows.
- **Method 2: No password method.** For Macs that block the program's files
  and ask for an administrator password you don't have. You type two short
  commands into Terminal instead of double-clicking.

Try Method 1 first. Steps 1 and 2 are the same for both methods.

## Method 1: Double-click

### Step 1. Install Anaconda
- Go to **https://www.anaconda.com/download** and download the installer for
  your computer (Mac or Windows).
- Open the downloaded file and follow the prompts, keeping the suggested
  choices.
- On Windows, choose **"Just Me"** when asked who to install for.
- Skip this step if Anaconda or Miniconda is already installed.

### Step 2. Get the program folder
- Download the program as a **.zip** file. You can get it from whoever
  shared the program with you, or from GitHub (green **Code** button →
  **Download ZIP**).
- Double-click the .zip file to unzip it.
- Move the unzipped folder somewhere easy to find, such as **Documents**.

### Step 3. Run the installer
- Open the program folder.
- **Mac:** double-click **Install Track Tamer.command**.
- **Windows:** double-click **Install Track Tamer.bat**.
- A window with text opens. This is normal.

**If the Mac says the file "can't be opened"** or is from an unidentified
developer:
1. Right-click (or Control-click) the file and choose **Open**.
2. Click **Open** in the message that appears.

If that doesn't work, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll
down, and click **Open Anyway**. If it asks for a password you don't have,
use **Method 2** instead.

**If Windows shows "Windows protected your PC":** click **More info**, then
**Run anyway**.

### Step 4. Wait for "Done"
- The installer downloads what the program needs. This takes several
  minutes. Let it run.
- When it says **Done**, press **Return** (Mac) or any key (Windows) to close
  the window.
- If it says **Failed**, see *If something goes wrong* below.

### Step 5. Open the program
- **Mac:** double-click **Open Track Tamer.command**.
- **Windows:** double-click **Open Track Tamer.bat**.
- A text window opens first, then the program. **Leave the text window open**
  while you use the program. Closing it closes the program.
- From now on, this is the only step you need to start the program.

## Method 2: No password method (Mac)

This method runs the same files through **Terminal**, the Mac's built-in
text window, so macOS doesn't block them and no password is needed.

### Step 1. Install Anaconda
- Same as Method 1, Step 1.

### Step 2. Get the program folder
- Same as Method 1, Step 2.

### Step 3. Open Terminal
- Press **Command (⌘) + Space**, type **Terminal**, and press **Return**.
- A window opens where you can type.

### Step 4. Run the installer
- Type **`bash`** followed by **one space**. Don't press Return yet.
- Drag **Install Track Tamer.command** from the program folder into the
  Terminal window. Its location appears after `bash `.
- Press **Return**.

It should look similar to this (your location will differ):

```
bash /Users/yourname/Documents/Track\ Tamer/Install\ Track\ Tamer.command
```

### Step 5. Wait for "Done"
- The installer takes several minutes. Let it run.
- When it says **Done**, press **Return**.
- If it says **Failed**, see *If something goes wrong* below.

### Step 6. Open the program
- In Terminal, type **`bash`** followed by **one space**.
- Drag **Open Track Tamer.command** into the Terminal window.
- Press **Return**. The program opens.
- **Leave Terminal open** while you use the program. Closing it closes the
  program.
- Repeat this step whenever you want to start the program.

**Tip:** in Terminal, press the **up arrow (↑)** to bring back the last
command, then press **Return** to run it again. This saves dragging the file
each time.

### On Windows
Windows doesn't usually need a password for these files. If double-clicking
is blocked:
1. Open the **Start** menu, type **Anaconda Prompt**, and open it.
2. Drag **Install Track Tamer.bat** into the window and press **Enter**.
3. When it says Done, drag **Open Track Tamer.bat** in the same way to
   start the program.

## Updating the program
- Replace the program folder with the new version.
- Run the installer again (Step 3 of Method 1, or Step 4 of Method 2). It
  updates what's already installed, so it's faster the second time.
- If the program ever says *"the program's package list has changed since it
  was installed"*, that also means: run the installer again.

## Removing the program
- Run **Uninstall Track Tamer** the same way you ran the installer, and
  type **y** when asked.
- This removes only what the installer added. Your data files and results
  are kept.
- You can then delete the program folder.

## If something goes wrong
- **"Anaconda wasn't found on this computer"**
  - Install Anaconda (Step 1). If you just installed it, restart the computer
    and try again.
- **"Install failed"**
  - Check your internet connection and run the installer again.
- **"Track Tamer isn't installed yet"**
  - Run the installer first, then open the program.
- **"Some videos are hard to read," or a video won't open**
  - Convert the video to .mp4 (H.264), for example with HandBrake (free), and
    add the converted copy.
- **Tracking or Export says a file couldn't be saved**
  - Results are saved next to each video or CSV, so that folder must be one
    you can save into (not a read-only drive or a zip you haven't unzipped).
    If an `_analysis.xlsx` or `_LocationOutput.csv` is open in Excel, close
    it and try again.
- **Windows: "An Application Control policy has blocked this file"**
  - Windows 11's **Smart App Control** (or a work or school computer's IT
    policy) blocked one of the program's files. Version 0.9 used a package
    (scipy) that this happened to; newer versions don't need it, so download
    the program again and replace the old folder.
  - If it still happens with another file, check **Windows Security → App &
    browser control → Smart App Control**. On a work or school computer, ask
    IT to allow Python in the Anaconda folder. Turning Smart App Control off
    is a big change (Windows only lets you turn it back on by reinstalling),
    so it's your call, or IT's.
- **The program closes with an error**
  - Take a screenshot of the text window and send it to whoever shared the
    program with you.
