# Behavior Tracker

Tracks a rodent's position in **videos** of an Elevated Plus Maze or Open
Field, and analyzes location tracking CSVs (`*_LocationOutput.csv`: one row per
video frame with position, region, and distance data, from this program or
from ezTrack), turning them into summary metrics, time-binned tables, path
plots, and occupancy heatmaps.

## Installing and running

For a step-by-step guide written for non-programmers, including a method
that needs no administrator password, see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

### With Anaconda (recommended, Mac or Windows)
1. Install [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) if the
   computer doesn't have it.
2. Get the program folder: download the zip from GitHub (or `git clone`).
   The repository is private, so others need access or a zip from you. Copy
   the folder **without** its `.venv`, if it has one.
3. Double-click **`Install Behavior Tracker.command`** (Mac) or
   **`Install Behavior Tracker.bat`** (Windows). It finds Anaconda, builds the
   program's own environment (`behavior-tracker`, from `environment.yml`,
   using the free conda-forge channel), and says Done or Failed. It only needs
   doing once; run it again after an update to bring the environment up to
   date.
4. From then on, double-click **`Open Behavior Tracker.command`** (Mac) or
   **`Open Behavior Tracker.bat`** (Windows). If the program's package list has
   changed since you installed, it says so; run the installer again.

**First time on a Mac:** macOS may block a downloaded script. Right-click the
file → **Open** → **Open**; after that, double-clicking works.
**On Windows:** if SmartScreen warns about the file, click **More info** →
**Run anyway**. A console window stays open while the app runs and shows any
error messages.

**Uninstall:** `Uninstall Behavior Tracker.command` / `.bat` removes the
environment only; the program folder and your data, results and settings
stay.

### Without Anaconda
The Open launchers fall back to a local Python environment (`.venv`), built
and filled automatically on the first run. On Windows this needs Python 3 from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick "Add python.exe to
PATH" during setup).

To run from a terminal instead:

```bash
conda activate behavior-tracker && python gui.py   # Anaconda
./.venv/bin/python gui.py                          # .venv, Mac
.venv\Scripts\python.exe gui.py                     # .venv, Windows
```

## What it computes

**Elevated Plus Maze** (when Test is EPM): open/closed-arm and center time,
% open time (of arm time), arm and center entries, % open entries, Anxiety
Index, closed/open time ratio, and latency to first open/closed/center entry.
An entry only counts once the animal stays in a region for at least **Min
entry (frames)** (default 5), which filters jitter at region boundaries.

**Open Field** (when Test is Open Field): center time and %, center entries
(a return within **Min time between center entries**, default 1 s, is the
same visit), latency to the center, time on each side, field crossings
(opposite sides, and adjoining sides when the center visit lasted at least
the adjoining minimum, default 0.5 s), and crossing speed (average and
peak, smoothed over **Speed smoothing (frames)**, default 5). Sides are judged
against the center ROI's lines exactly as drawn in the file (each edge
extended across the arena), with the top of the video as the top of the
arena.

Every analyzed row records the settings that produced it (test, entry rule,
and the Open Field thresholds), so exported tables show how they were made.

**Key measures** come first, on screen and in exports. For the Elevated
Plus Maze they are, in order: closed/open time ratio, center time, % center
(of the session), open-arm time, % open (of arm time), closed-arm time, %
closed (of arm time), open entries, and closed entries. The Summary tab shows
only these by default; tick **More test measures**, **Session basics** and the
other boxes to add columns. Open Field shows its basics and test measures.

**Summary metrics** (one row per file):
- Total distance (cm / px), duration, mean speed
- Time and percent spent in each region (e.g. center / periphery, or each EPM
  arm), and entries into each region under the same entry rule as the test
  measures, plus region-to-region transitions
- **One region per frame:** a point on a border the center shares (or in a
  drawn overlap) counts for the **center only**, so each arm's time is exactly
  its own time and the per-region numbers always add up to the test totals
  (e.g. closed-arm time = closed arm 1 + closed arm 2). Only the center may
  share; frames in two other regions are counted for the first and reported
  in a warning. Tracking writes border pixels to the center only, too.
- The tracking settings recorded in the file

**Time bins** (per file): the session split into fixed-length bins (default
60 s) with distance, mean speed, and time-in-zone per bin, plus the chosen
test's measures for each bin (EPM: arm/center time, entries, % open, Anxiety
Index, ratio; Open Field: center time and entries, side times, crossings, and
crossing speed). Entries and crossings are counted in the bin where they
start, so the bins add up to the session totals. Latency is session-only.

**Plots** (per file): path/trajectory (colored by speed or one solid color) and
occupancy heatmap, both with ROI outlines. The heatmap labels each region
outside the ROIs so the data stays visible. Each tab has a **Background**
choice:
- **None:** no background. Heatmap cells the animal never entered stay
  empty, which makes them transparent in a saved PNG.
- **Flat color** (Heatmap only): fills those cells with one color, which is
  easy to recolor in an image editor.
- **Reference image:** draws the plot on the arena's empty-arena image in
  gray. It is only available for files tracked in this program, which keep a
  `_reference.png` next to the tracking file.

## Tracking videos

Videos (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.wmv`, `.mpg`, `.mkv`, `.m4v`) go in the same
file list as CSVs, marked **Video**. Tracking is adapted from ezTrack (see
Credits).

1. **Add the videos** as you would CSVs, and choose the **Test** first (the
   regions to draw depend on it). Each video starts as **Needs setup**. If a
   video has frames that can't be read, you're asked whether to add it
   anyway. Converting it (e.g. to .mp4 with H.264) usually fixes this.
2. **Set up videos…** opens one window for all of them, with six steps per
   video. **Next** moves on, or says what's missing. The arrows at the top
   switch videos, and **Start from previous video** copies the last video's
   choices as a draft to check. Scroll to zoom on any image, and right-drag
   or Control-drag to move around.
   1. **Trim and crop:** scrub to the trial's start, choose the session
      length (EPM 5 min; Open Field 1 or 1.5 h, or type one), and drag a
      rectangle around the arena.
   2. **Exclusions:** optionally outline areas to ignore, such as a cable
      or a reflection.
   3. **Reference:** make the empty-arena image from frames across the
      trial. The animal drops out because it's in a different place in
      most of them.
   4. **Tracking check:** scrub to any frame to see where the animal is
      found (red cross), and adjust the tracking settings. The settings are
      shared by every video and lock at the first Track.
   5. **Regions:** draw the test's regions on the reference.
      - Elevated Plus Maze: open arm 1 and 2, closed arm 1 and 2, center.
      - Open Field: the arena outline and the center. The periphery is the
        outline minus the center.
      - Points lock onto neighboring regions' points and edges, so regions
        share borders instead of overlapping.
   6. **Scale:** click two points a known distance apart and type that
      distance. EPM: 75 cm, from the end of one arm to the end of the
      opposite arm. Open Field: 40 cm along one wall.

   A video with every step done shows **Ready to track**.
3. **Track** works on the selected videos, one at a time in the background.
   - A bar at the bottom shows progress, and **Cancel** keeps the videos
     already finished.
   - If a video already has a tracking file beside it, you're asked whether
     to use it or track again.
   - If the videos' frame rate differs from the **Frame rate** setting, you
     can switch the setting to the videos' rate.
   - Each video gets `<name>_LocationOutput.csv` (ezTrack's format, plus
     every setting used and a `Frame_Unreadable` column) and
     `<name>_reference.png` next to it, and becomes **Not analyzed**.
4. **Analyze** and **Export** as for CSVs (below).
5. **Play video…** (Path and Heatmap tabs) plays a tracked file's video with
   its tracked position drawn on, to check the tracking.
   - It shows a red marker, a short trail, region outlines, the time, and
     the current region.
   - **Save as video…** writes `<name>_tracked.mp4` next to the video, at
     its real frame rate. It plays on Mac and Windows.
   - It works for any file tracked in this program whose video is in the
     same folder.

**Unreadable frames** stay in the tracking file as rows with no position. By
default they add no time, distance or entries. Turning on **Fill short gaps**
in the settings panel instead joins gaps of up to the chosen length with a
straight line for the analysis. The saved file is never changed.

## Window layout

The **left panel** holds the **Files** buttons (Add files…, Add folder…,
Remove, Clear) and the **Run** buttons (Set up videos… and Track when videos
are listed, Select all, Analyze, Export), then the settings, with **About**
at the bottom. In a short window the panel scrolls. The file list sits above
the tabs. The **Path** and **Heatmap** tabs have their controls in a column
beside the plot: point or cell style, Background, **Region labels** (show or
hide the region names on the plot and in the exported image), and **Play
video…**.

## Working with files
1. **Add files…**, **Add folder…**, or drag files/folders onto the window.
   Files build up the **file list** (always visible above the tabs), each
   marked **Not analyzed**. Adding a file that's already in the list asks
   whether to add it again. **Remove** takes the selected files out of the
   list (the files themselves aren't touched).
2. Choose the **Test** (Elevated Plus Maze / Open Field), **frame rate**
   (default 20 fps), and **bin size** in the settings panel on the left.
3. **Analyze** works on the **selected** files; its button shows how many
   (e.g. **Analyze (1)**). The first file added is selected for you. Click
   **Select all** (or Ctrl+A / Cmd+A in the list) to select every file, or
   Shift/Ctrl/Cmd-click to pick a few. Nothing is computed until you click
   Analyze. At the first Analyze, the settings panel **locks** ("Locked.
   Clear to change."), so every file in the load is analyzed the same way.
   Path and Heatmap styling never locks.
4. **Click a file** in the list (or a row in the Summary) to see its Time
   Bins, Path, and Heatmap.
5. **Clear** empties the list and unlocks the settings, e.g. to try one file,
   adjust the settings, then run a whole folder.

The file list resets when the app closes. Settings, plot style, Summary
columns, and region roles are remembered. **Regions…** sets what each region
in the files means (open arm, closed arm, center, periphery). **About** shows
credits, the ezTrack citation, and the license.

## Exporting

**Export** writes, for each selected file that has been analyzed, three
files **next to its source CSV**, named after it, overwriting any earlier
export:

- `<name>_analysis.xlsx`: **Summary** (the file's row), **Time Bins**, and
  **Settings** (everything used to produce the results: test, frame rate,
  entry rule, Open Field thresholds, gap filling, region roles, bin size, the
  Path and Heatmap plot settings, how the file was tracked (method,
  threshold, window, downsampling, crop, reference frames, exclusion shapes,
  start frame, frame rate, scale), and for videos the session's start and
  length and the regions drawn).
- `<name>_path.png` and `<name>_heatmap.png`: drawn with the current on-screen
  plot settings at a fixed size (5 × 4.5 in, 200 dpi), whatever the window
  size, with a transparent background (heatmap cells the animal never
  entered stay transparent unless the background is a flat color; over the
  reference image the PNG isn't transparent).

For a video, these go next to the video. Tracking already saved
`<name>_LocationOutput.csv` and `<name>_reference.png` there.

Only analyzed files are exported. If a workbook is open in Excel, close it
before exporting again.

bundled into a standalone app (e.g. with PyInstaller).
